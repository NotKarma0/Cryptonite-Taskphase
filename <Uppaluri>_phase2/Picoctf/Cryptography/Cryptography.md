# 1. miniRSA
> What happens if you have a small exponent? There is a twist though, we padded the plaintext so that (M ** e) is just barely larger than N. Let's decrypt this: ciphertext

## Solution: 
- I just went into RSA cipher decryption. and decrypted it using the given values.

## flag: 
```
picoCTF{n33d_a_lArg3r_e_ccaa7776}
```

## Resources: 
- This is what i used to decrypt. https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher
