# 1. Cookies
> Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:17781/

## Solution:

- Since the challenge is named as cookies. Once i loaded into the website i opened to check the cookies by inspecting the page. 
- I saw that there was one cookie named as name with a value of -1.
- There was an example of a cookie called snickerdoodle in that site. Once i typed it in and refreshed i saw the cookie value changed to 0
- I concluded that every different values has different flavours of cookie saying it wasnt the special one.
- I found that 29th value is the max value meaning i can now check every value of cookie until 29 manually.
- Hence, once i entered 18 i got the flag showing the cookie.

# 2. Web Gauntlet
> Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:53676/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:53676/filter.php

## Solution:

- From the syntax of Select From Users where and so on, its idetifiable that sql injection can be used in here.
- Initially I tried doing admin' OR '1'=='1 as the username. But for some reason though it didnt show any error it didnt let me proceed to the second round.
- But then when i did filter.php, i found that OR is blocked.
- So the next thing i did was use comment lines which is -- as it is in SQL language.
- In round 2 that was filtered too, so what i did was the other form of comments /*
- In round 3 u can use semicolon to end the program over there
- In round 4 cancatination of a string can be used by ad'||'min';
- In round 5 the same worked.

## Concepts learnt:

- Different types of Sql injections. Such as ;, concatenation and sql comments.

## Notes:

- SQL injection first needs to be identified. The programming language of the website too needs to be identified. And should figure out the source code if not given to the approx.
