# 1. Cookies
> Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:17781/

## Solution:

- Since the challenge is named as cookies. Once i loaded into the website i opened to check the cookies by inspecting the page. 
- I saw that there was one cookie named as name with a value of -1.
- There was an example of a cookie called snickerdoodle in that site. Once i typed it in and refreshed i saw the cookie value changed to 0
- I concluded that every different values has different flavours of cookie saying it wasnt the special one.
- I found that 29th value is the max value meaning i can now check every value of cookie until 29 manually.
- Hence, once i entered 18 i got the flag showing the cookie.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_bb3b3535}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Knew this before.

## Notes:

- Apparently burpsuite can be used told by my friend. I need to research how to do it with burpsuite later on.

## Resources:

- None

# 2. Web Gauntlet
> Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:53676/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:53676/filter.php

## Solution:

- From the syntax of Select From Users where and so on, its idetifiable that sql injection can be used in here.
- Initially I tried doing admin' OR '1'=='1 as the username. But for some reason though it didnt show any error it didnt let me proceed to the second round.
- But then when i did filter.php, i found that OR is blocked.
- So the next thing i did was use comment lines which is -- as it is in SQL language.
- In round 2 that was filtered too, so what i did was the other form of comments /*
- In round 3 u can use semicolon to end the program over there
- In round 4 cancatination of a string can be used by ad'||'min';
- In round 5 the same worked.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}

```

## Concepts learnt:

- Different types of Sql injections. Such as ;, concatenation and sql comments.

## Notes:

- SQL injection first needs to be identified. The programming language of the website too needs to be identified. And should figure out the source code if not given to the approx.

# 3.SSTI1
> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!


## Solution:

- So basically if only one particular part of a website is changing based off on what the user is entering and it displays what is being entered. 
- To take advantage of this, what we are doing is using commands that we know to open the files listed in the website's actual workspace.
- So when u do it it shows uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root). And now since we know the basic list and cat uses. It can be used here. And when u do cat flag the flag is shown.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_9451989d}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I kind of learnt the concept of server side template injection, but do not have full clarity.

## Notes:

- {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}
- {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -l').read()}}
- {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}
